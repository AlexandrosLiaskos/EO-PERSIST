## Definition

- Remote sensing is the process of measurement or acquisition of information about an object, property, or phenomenon by a recording device that is not in physical or intimate contact with the subject under study.

## Key Components

1. **Remote**:
    - Refers to gathering information without physical contact
    - Distance can range from slightly away to very far away
2. **Sensing**:
    - Involves collecting information/data/input
    - Examples of data types include:
        - Temperature
        - Pressure
        - Photographic imagery

## Historical Context

- Term coined by Evelyn Pruitt in the 1950s
- Originally defined as "the science and art of identifying, observing, and measuring an object without coming into direct contact with it"
- Developed at the US Office of Naval Research

## Applications

### Satellite Remote Sensing

- Primary modern application
- Characteristics:
    - Uses sensors onboard orbiting satellites
    - Employs scanners and cameras
    - Scans Earth's surface
    - Transmits images back to Earth

### Other Applications

- Medical imaging:
    - Sonograms
    - X-rays
- Any technology that collects data without direct physical contact

## Key Insight

- While commonly associated with satellite technology, remote sensing is a broader concept that encompasses any form of non-contact measurement or data collection
