	<br>
- **Opportunities**:
    - Promote pioneering research
    - Promote socio-economic studies in the Arctic

## Experimental Analysis
- **Focus**:
    - Five use cases
	<br>
- **Purpose**:
    - Serve as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) of the system

## Use Cases
- **UC 1**:
    - Land degradation
	<br>
- **UC 2**:
    - Temperature anomalies
	<br>
- **UC 3**:
    - Coastal monitoring and modeling
	<br>
- **UC 4**:
    - Active layer freeze-thaw cycle monitoring using TSInSAR
	<br>
- **UC 5**:
    - Exploitation of low frequency SAR

## Specific Objectives
- **O1**:
    - Exploitation of the cloud processing resources and big data EO archives to construct EO-PERSIST system
	<br>
- **O2**:
    - Development and implementation of novel RS algorithms (e.g. TSInSAR methods, CNN, SR methods) to support the assessment of permafrost changes
	<br>
- **O3**:
    - Deploying geographical information systems (GIS)-based models (e.g. multivariate analysis, gap filling) to big geospatial datasets for permafrost dynamics monitoring
	<br>
- **O4**:
    - Definition and development of socioeconomic indicators for the sustainable development of the Arctic region taking into account land degradation, temperature anomalies and coastal erosion caused by permafrost dynamics and changes
	<br>
- **O5**:
    - Sharing multidisciplinary knowledge (Earth's processes modeling (EPM), RS, GIS, and cloud computing (CC)) and know-how among the partners, while aligning different scientific cultures for the integration of the knowledge from the permafrost domain to resolve the scientific questions
	<br>
- **O6**:
    - Promotion of skills and careers of the exchanged staff. The seconded staff are going to be re-integrated to the sending companies/institutes with an in-build return mechanism for further exploitation of their newly acquired and enhanced skills and knowledge
	<br>
- **O7**:
    - Pushing the conducted complementary research of the partners to the market by creating added value products that correspond to:
        - a sustainable Arctic EO-based system
        - improved algorithms for permafrost studies
        - socioeconomic indicators based on RS outputs and GIS models that will make a positive contribution to decision-making processes
		<br>
- **O8**:
    - Ensure the sustainability and long-term business value of the project
