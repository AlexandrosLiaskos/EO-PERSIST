# Specific Objectives

- **O1**: Exploitation of the cloud processing resources and big data EO archives to construct EO-PERSIST system

- **O2**: Development and implementation of novel RS algorithms (e.g. TSInSAR methods, CNN, SR methods) to support the assessment of permafrost changes

- **O3**: Deploying geographical information systems (GIS)-based models (e.g. multivariate analysis, gap filling) to big geospatial datasets for permafrost dynamics monitoring

- **O4**: Definition and development of socioeconomic indicators for the sustainable development of the Arctic region taking into account land degradation, temperature anomalies and coastal erosion caused by permafrost dynamics and changes

- **O5**: Sharing multidisciplinary knowledge (Earth's processes modeling (EPM), RS, GIS, and cloud computing (CC)) and know-how among the partners, while aligning different scientific cultures for the integration of the knowledge from the permafrost domain to resolve the scientific questions

- **O6**: Promotion of skills and careers of the exchanged staff. The seconded staff are going to be re-integrated to the sending companies/institutes with an in-build return mechanism for further exploitation of their newly acquired and enhanced skills and knowledge

- **O7**: Pushing the conducted complementary research of the partners to the market by creating added value products that correspond to:
    - a sustainable Arctic EO-based system
    - improved algorithms for permafrost studies
    - socioeconomic indicators based on RS outputs and GIS models that will make a positive contribution to decision-making processes

- **O8**: Ensure the sustainability and long-term business value of the project
